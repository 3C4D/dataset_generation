# Patch note

As we can see, the table Object_Sensitivity has been modified.

It's now a double entry table. The point is to have all objects/controllers
pairs.

## Profiles program

To use the profiles.py program, you have to give it one parameter, the
percentage of extreme profiles you want to put in the dataset files.

```
Usage : profiles.py percentage
```

The program will replace the files concerned by the profiles.
