# Study of Litterature in research of data from user studies

## 1. Sharing policies in multiuser privacy scenarios:Incorporating context, preferences, and arguments in decision making

In this document, we can see a few helpful data in figure 2.

The context shows that, in the scenarios of conflicts, the number of situation
where people are either friends, family or colleagues are almost equals.

The probability in our Relationship table will be a uniform distribution where
the value can be 0, 1 or 3, respectively family, friend or colleague.

Unfortunately, the case where people are for example family AND friend aren't
mentionned. We are not considering this sort of case for the moment.


Also in this figure, we can see data about the sensitivity rating of the objects
(between 1 and 5). We see that the mean is 3, that means that most of the time,
people consider the object having a medium sensitivity. Also, objects have
rarely a sensitivity below 2, although they can have a sensitivity of 5 in some
cases.

With these data, we can establish that the sensisivity will be generated for our
table with a normal distribution. The mean will be 5 (mid/mid-high) in a scale
of 7 values (1-7). The standard deviation will be 2.
